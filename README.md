## Twitter Scraping Script for Job Openings and Layoffs

### Overview:
This Python script scrapes data from two Twitter accounts, **@RemoteOK** and **@WhatLayoff**, to gather information about tech job openings across North America and layoffs happening across companies, respectively. The script runs daily and retrieves tweets posted within the last 24 hours, storing the data in a CSV file for local analysis and reference.

### Features:
- Scrapes tweets from two Twitter accounts: **@RemoteOK** and **@WhatLayoff**.
- Collects data on tech job openings (from **@RemoteOK**) and layoffs (from **@WhatLayoff**).
- Uses the date function to retrieve tweets posted within the last 24 hours.
- Stores the scraped data in a CSV file for local storage and analysis.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries (e.g., `tweepy` for Twitter API access).
3. Set up your Twitter API credentials (if required) and configure the script.
4. Run the script daily to scrape and store the latest tweets from the specified accounts.


### Configuration:
- Modify the script to include your Twitter API credentials (if required).
- Adjust the accounts to scrape and any other parameters as needed.

### Disclaimer:
- Ensure compliance with Twitter's Terms of Service and API usage policies.
- Respect the privacy and usage guidelines of the scraped data.
